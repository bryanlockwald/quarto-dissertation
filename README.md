# quarto-dissertation

This Quarto template renders a PDF of a dissertation/thesis with formatting for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It was initially designed based on the University of Pittsburgh LaTeX template. This template is intended to help scholars create their reproducible dissertations/theses. I have gratefully borrowed this template from an extension created by \href{https://github.com/alberto-guzman/quarto-dissertation}{Alberto Guzman}.

The extension primarily uses Quarto and a series of LaTeX partials in the tex folder. Additionally, the template was created for a 3-paper dissertation/thesis, although it can be easily modified to accommodate a traditional dissertationâ€”just swap the .qmd files with your dissertation chapters.
