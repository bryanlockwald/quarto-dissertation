# quarto-dissertation

This Quarto template renders a PDF of a dissertation/thesis with formatting for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It was initially designed based on the University of Pittsburgh [LaTeX](https://etd.pitt.edu/latex-template) template and was inspired by [Alberto Guzman's repository](https://github.com/alberto-guzman/quarto-dissertation).

The extension primarily uses Quarto and a series of LaTeX partials in the tex folder. Additionally, the template was created for a 3-paper dissertation/thesis, although it can be easily modified to accommodate other formats.
