    {Verification is a federally mandated process that requires selected students
    to further attest that the information reported on their Free Application for
    Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is accurate and complete. In this brief, we
    estimate institutional costs of administrating the FAFSA verification mandate
    and consider variation in costs by institution type and sector. Using data
    from 2014, we estimate that compliance costs to institutions in that year
    totaled nearly US\$500 million with the burden falling disproportionately on
    public institutions and community colleges, in particular. Specifically, we
    estimate that 22\% of an average community college's financial aid office
    operating budget is devoted to verification procedures, compared with 15\% at
    public 4-year institutions. Our analysis is timely, given that rates of FAFSA
    verification have increased in recent years.}
