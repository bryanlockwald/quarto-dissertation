## Introduction

### Background

\[Background of the research problem and context\]

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-species-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Penguin Species by Island"
#| echo: false
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Island", y = "Count", title = "Penguin Species Distribution") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Data

\[Description of data sources and collection methods\]

```{r}
#| label: tbl-species-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics by Species"
#| echo: false
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```
