## Section

As an example of a reference to a figure @ref(penguine_plot), this should render with the propper figure number and place in the TOC.  Greart!!

```{r penguine_plot, fig.cap="Palmer Penguine Plot as Example"}

# Create a scatter plot of penguins with body mass on the x-axis and flipper length on the y-axis
#| label: example-Palmer_Penguines
#| fig-cap: "Palmer Penguines as Example"
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin Body Mass vs. Flipper Length",
    x = "Body Mass (g)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
    color = "Species"

  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
